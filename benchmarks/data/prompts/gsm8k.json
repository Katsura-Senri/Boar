  "least-to-most_prompt": "Q: Elsa has 5 apples. Anna has 2 more apples than Elsa. How many apples do they have together?\nA: To answer the question \"How many apples do they have together?\", we need to know: \"How many apples does Anna have?\".\n1.

Since Rena will be 5 years older than Pam in 10 years, she must be 5 years older than Pam now as well.\n2. If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena, that means that Rena is currently twice as old as Pam is. So if P stands for Pam's age now and R stands for Rena's age now, then we know that R = 2 * P And since Rena is 5 years older than Pam now, we know that R = P + 5. By substitution, we have P + 5 = 2 * P, which means that P = 5. So the answer is 5."
