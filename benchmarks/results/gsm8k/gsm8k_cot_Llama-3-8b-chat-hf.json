He puts in $50,000 in repairs, so the total investment is $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.\n3. The value of the house increases by 150% due to the repairs. To find the new value, multiply the original value by (1 + 0.15) = 2.3:\n$80,000 x 2.3 = $184,000\n\nThe profit is the difference between the new value and Josh's total investment:\n\n$184,000 (new value) - $130,000 (total investment) = $54,000\n\nSo Josh made a profit of $54,000.", "extracted answer": "54000", "true answer": " 70000", "evaluation": {"correctness": false}}]
